I am Lu He, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine. I am part of the Health and Information Lab, advised by Dr. Kai Zheng. My research interests lie at the intersection of health informatics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and data science. I evaluate, develop, and apply human-centered data science methods to various health data, including social media posts related to major health events, clinical notes, and online physician reviews.
